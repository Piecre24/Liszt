## Code of Conduct
### Expectation setting:

Work hours 9:00am - 6:00pm. We will aim to wrap up around 6:00pm. (7:00pm max!)

Saturday 10:30am - 3:00pm.

### Stress management & wellbeing:
Al: Needs to reach out for help when stuck, technically or emotionally. Maintain honesty and openness.

Crystal: Requires honest and efficient communication from team mates. Needs breaks.

Kenneth: Needs reassurance and help.

Tai: Needs team mates to offer help, and prompts to take a break.

Tom: Needs regular communication where each team member is at. Appreciates check ins on stress.

### Conflict management:
the team is a democracy. Decisions are made by concensus.

When conflict arises, every member will acknowledge it.

We have agreed that conflict is not to be taken personally, and we can benefit from ironing issues out quickly.

Reduce potential instances of conflict by mainting accountability for our work.

Show empathy.

### Communication:
We will strive to maintain high and open communication.

### How we will work:
We will adopt Agile team principles as a loose guideline for our roles. Each day someone will have the opportunity to step into Scrum Master. Each member has an obligation to communicate regularly and will take on 'Vibes lead'. Tasks will be broken down to small and clear areas of ownership. We will track our tasks via ticketing and assigning fibonacci values to represent their difficulty.

### Getting help:
We have established a system for helping each other and reaching out to our facilitators for help.

We will use previous code examples, google searches, and youtube tutorials to help us get to where we need to be.

When we are stuck and our team is unable to help each other we will concisely sum up our area of struggle with a well thought out question, outlining the approaches we have undertaken to efficiently reach a solution. 

We have acknowledged that approaching team members is not considered interrupting.
